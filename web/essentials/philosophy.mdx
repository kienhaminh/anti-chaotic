## The Problem with AI coding

AI is powerful, but chaotic. Without guardrails, AI agents can:

- Generate inconsistent code styles.
- Hallucinate dependencies.
- Lose context in long conversations.

## The Anti-Chaotic Solution

We believe in **Constraint-Based Autonomy**.

> "Freedom is not the absence of structure, but the presence of the right structure."

Anti-Chaotic provides:

1.  **Strict Workflows**: Agents follow defined steps (Planning -> Execution -> Verification).
2.  **Role Separation**: Specialized agents for distinct domains (Frontend, Backend, DevOps).
3.  **Artifact Persistence**: Saving state to `brain/` folders to maintain context.
