## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize in your project

Run the following command in your project root to install the Agent Kit:

```bash
npx @kienha/anti-chaotic init
```

This will download the `.agent` folder containing all skills, rules, and workflows into your project.

### 2. Using the Agent Kit

Once initialized, start a new chat with your AI IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and reference the installed rules/workflows.

#### Start a new project with AI:

```
/requirement-analysis Create a sales management application for a fashion store
```

#### Generate docs for an existing project:

```
/generate-docs-from-codebase
```

#### Design UI from requirements:

```
/ui-ux-design-from-doc docs/020-Requirements/PRD-YourProject.md
```

### 3. Updating the Kit

To update your Agent Kit to the latest version:

```bash
npx @kienha/anti-chaotic update
```

## 🎓 Workflow Details

## 🔄 Automated Workflows

| Workflow                           | Description                                                                                                   | Use Case                                                                        |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`/requirement-analysis`**        | Analyzes raw requirements and generates detailed documentation (Roadmap, PRD, SDD, Epics, User Stories).      | Start of a new project or feature when you only have a rough idea.              |
| **`/generate-docs-from-codebase`** | Scans the current codebase and generates comprehensive documentation (Architecture, API, Schema).             | Onboarding to a legacy project or updating docs after development.              |
| **`/ui-ux-design-from-doc`**       | Transforms PRD/requirements documents into UI/UX design specifications, design systems, and visual artifacts. | After requirements are finalized, before coding.                                |
| **`/workflow-rule-from-codebase`** | Analyzes the codebase to identify patterns and conventions, creating a project-specific rules file.           | Establishing coding standards for a new or existing team.                       |
| **`/workflow-rule-from-feedback`** | Updates or creates rules based on user feedback to prevent recurring AI errors.                               | When the Agent makes repeated mistakes or you want to enforce a new preference. |

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

1. **Read output carefully before approving** - Each step has a checkpoint for review
2. **Use artifacts for comments** - AI will create draft files for you to review first
3. **Provide complete context** - Describe requirements in detail from the start
4. **Chain workflows** - Combine multiple workflows for a complete process

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Skip clarification step** - The clarification step is crucial
2. **Approve without reading** - Always review before confirming
3. **Run inappropriate workflows** - Choose the right workflow for the right use case

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue                      | Solution                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow doesn't run       | Check slash command syntax                    |
| Output has wrong format    | Ensure `.agent/rules/documentation.md` exists |
| AI asks too many questions | Provide more context in the initial request   |
